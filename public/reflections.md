# End of Quarter reflection 
## CATRIZ, Evan Anthony A. | 9 - Cesium

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
☆ Conditional Operators <br>
    The conditional operators in Javascript are very similar to the ones on C++ down to the syntax, with the exception of the ternary operator, yet it is still quite doable to learn. Due to this, we have enough practice with these throughout the years which helps me masterize this topic. It is also easy to understand and apply to my code. <br>
☆ Output/Display <br>
    The output methods of Javascript are really simple and easy to understand and use. Also, it is quite similar to the output methods of Python, so there are a couple of exercises that helped me understand and prepare for it. <br>
☆ Arithmetic Operators <br>
    The arithmetic operators used in Javascript are really similar to the ones used in Python and C++. It is also really simple to use and very straightforward. Because of this, I have already masterized these topics and can use them easily in my code. <br>
☆ Variable Declaration <br>
    Declaring variables in Javascript is suprisingly easier than at C++ and Python since you don't have to specify what type of input/value it should accept. You either use the local declaration "let" (variable that only works to code statements below it) and global declaration "var" (variable that also works to code statements below and above). This makes it really easy to understand and use in my code. <br>
☆ Javascript Syntax <br>
    Javascript Syntax is really easy to understand and learn. Since we have applied it to every single lesson and exercise through 1st Quarter, I believe I have already use and apply it with ease in my code. It also helps me understand the flow of the program and how each statement is run and how it contributes to the final output of the program. <br>

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
♦ Github and Git <br>
    Since this is my first time using these softwares when it comes to Computer Science, I have quite the difficulty understanding how each button functions and how I can save the answers to my HTML/Javascript exercises. But throughout the quarter, I may be catching on to how it works and be familarized with how I can save my output to each assesment, although I do need more help/discussion if I want to reach a mastery in this topic. <br>
♦ Loops <br>
    Even if Javascript loops have quite the same syntax and are really similar to loops in C++, I do have quite a hard time understanding and applying the correct/most fit type of loop to my code. I can use it quite comfortably however, but I may need more discussion about this topic for mastery. <br>
♦ Functions <br>
    The declaration and syntax of these functions are quite different from C++ and Python, so I find it quite challenging to understand and apply to my code. Although I may percieve it as simpler than C++, I do need some more discussion so that I can familiarize myself more with this topic. <br>
♦ Debugging <br>
    I have a really hard time trying to find errors in the code, and this is what makes it difficult for me to understand. I will need more discussion on this so that I can improve my skill and help identify the errors in my program. <br>
♦ VSCode <br>
    Because it is my first time using this software, I kind of have a hard time using it as my code. Although I may be able to familiarize myself with this software, I would probably need more discussion, especially with its connection to Github.

## 3. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
A plan I can do to help myself understand the topics futher is to ask my peers such as my classmates and friends for help so that I can get a clearer explanation and application of each topic. I can also consult with teachers and professionals so that I can gather advice from the ones that know about these topics the most. I can also try doing extra exercises on my own so that I can familiarize myself with the syntax and how to apply them in my code in my own pace.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
Useful Activities: <br>
⇑ Kahoot <br>
Kahoot works wonders and really helps me learn because I get to consume information and review while having a fun and competitive time against my classmates. It also encourages you to study more so that you can work harder and know more the next time it comes around. It is really one of the activities I like the most when it comes to modes of learning. <br>
⇑ Speed Tests <br>
Speed tests really help me when it comes to learning and reviewing because it encourages you to critically think fast and improve your cognitive ability. It also prepares me for Formative and Summative assesments such as the long test because it trains me for time pressure and haste code developing and debugging. It also rewards us with bonus points if we do it early and it really encourages us to go faster and think more critically. <br><br>
Not so Useful Activities: <br>
⇓ Graded Exercise (Exercise 4) <br>
Although this exercise helps us train for switch cases, it may be too easy for us to actually learn. This might be bad because we don't really get to use our critical thinking that much. <br>
⇓ Graded Exercise (Exercise 7) <br>
This exercise may help me learn more about debugging code and testing which works, but it also might be too hard for me. This is bad because I don't have a mastery on this topic yet and it's really hard to understand, which demotivates me from learning.
